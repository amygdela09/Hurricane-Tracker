# Hurricane-Tracker

This will eventually be incorporated into my NexradNext repo. 

A comprehensive, interactive web-based platform for monitoring and analyzing tropical cyclones and related weather phenomena in real-time. This tool integrates live storm data, historical tracks, environmental analysis layers, and real-time Hurricane Hunter aircraft tracking into a single, easy-to-use interface.

Features

This application combines data from numerous official and public sources to provide a multi-faceted view of the tropical weather environment.
üõ∞Ô∏è Live Tropical Cyclone Tracking
 * Official Forecasts: Plots the latest official forecast track and cone of uncertainty from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for all active storms.
 * Spaghetti Models: Overlays an ensemble of computer model predictions (spaghetti plots) to visualize forecast uncertainty.
 * Tropical Outlooks: Fetches and displays the latest text-based Tropical Weather Outlooks from the NHC, detailing potential areas for future development.
‚úàÔ∏è Live Hurricane Hunter Tracking
 * Real-Time Flight Paths: Integrates with live ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) data to track the flight paths of NOAA and USAF Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft.
 * Dynamic Updates: Aircraft positions, altitudes, callsigns, and flight trails are updated automatically on the map every 30 seconds.
 * Aircraft Details: Clicking on an aircraft icon reveals its callsign, speed, altitude, and heading.
‚õàÔ∏è Advanced Meteorological Analysis
Analyze the atmospheric conditions that fuel or inhibit tropical development with professional-grade data layers:
 * Sea Surface Temperature (SST): Visualizes the "ocean fuel" necessary for storms to form and intensify.
 * Vertical Wind Shear: Shows atmospheric disruption that can tear storms apart, a key inhibitor of development.
 * Steering Flow (500mb Winds): Displays the mid-level atmospheric winds that guide a storm's path.
 * Mid-Level Moisture: Highlights areas of moist, supportive air versus dry, inhibiting air (like the Saharan Air Layer).
üìñ Historical Storm Analysis
 * Historical Database: Switch to "Historical Mode" to explore the tracks of significant past hurricanes.
 * Intensity-Coded Tracks: Historical storm paths are color-coded based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, providing an at-a-glance view of the storm's intensification and weakening phases.
üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map Controls
 * Layer Toggling: A user-friendly, grouped layer control allows for toggling the visibility of every data layer, from storm tracks to analysis grids.
 * Basemap Selector: Switch between Street, Satellite, and Dark basemaps to customize your view.
 * Storm Selector: When multiple storms are active, a dropdown menu allows you to focus the map on a specific system.
   
Setup and Installation

This project is designed to be lightweight and accessible. It runs entirely in the browser without needing a complex backend.
 * Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hurricane-tracker.git
 * Get Your API Key:
   The Hurricane Hunter tracking feature requires a free API key from ADS-B Exchange.
   * Sign up for a key at ADS-B Exchange API Data.
   * Open the professional_tracker_with_hunters.html file in a text editor.
 * Insert Your API Key:
   Locate the following line in the <script> section and replace the placeholder with your key:
   // !!! IMPORTANT: REPLACE WITH YOUR KEY !!!
API_KEY: 'YOUR_ADS-B_EXCHANGE_API_KEY',

 * Run the Project:
   
   Simply open the professional_tracker_with_hunters.html file in any modern web browser.
   
Credits and Data Sources

This project would not be possible without the open data and software provided by the following organizations:
 * National Hurricane Center (NHC): For providing the foundational tropical cyclone advisories, text outlooks, and forecast data.
 * Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM): For providing the processed GeoJSON feeds for active storms, which simplifies the visualization of cones, tracks, and spaghetti models.
 * ADS-B Exchange: For offering the accessible, real-time API for tracking Hurricane Hunter aircraft.
 * NOAA Environmental Modeling Center (EMC): For the public Web Map Services (WMS) that provide the advanced analysis layers from the GFS model.
 * Leaflet.js: The core open-source mapping library that powers the entire interactive map.
 * OpenStreetMap & CartoDB: For the high-quality, free-to-use base map tiles.
 * Flaticon: For the airplane icon used for the Hurricane Hunter tracker.
